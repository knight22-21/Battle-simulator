Great! To prepare your full-stack Angular + Python project for deployment in an **offline DRDO environment**, you need to:

---

## ✅ 1. **Understand the Project Structure**

Assuming your project is structured like this:

```
project-root/
├── frontend/          # Angular app
├── backend/           # Python (FastAPI or Flask?) app
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

---

## 🔧 2. **Install Dependencies (Offline Setup)**

Since there’s no internet access, you must **pre-download** everything and transfer it via USB, CD, or local network.

---

### 🧩 A. FRONTEND (Angular)

You’ll need:

* **Node.js** (LTS version)
* **Angular CLI**
* **All npm dependencies**

#### 💻 Step-by-step:

### A.1: Install Node.js

On the DRDO system:

* Download the **offline installer** for Node.js (LTS version) from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
* Transfer and install it.

> ✅ Verify: `node -v` and `npm -v`

---

### A.2: Download Angular CLI Globally

On your internet-enabled machine:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Then locate the Angular CLI files:

```bash
npm pack @angular/cli
```

This creates a `.tgz` file you can transfer.

> On DRDO system:

```bash
npm install -g ./angular-cli-X.X.X.tgz
```

---

### A.3: Package Project Dependencies

Inside your `/frontend` directory:

```bash
npm install
```

Then use:

```bash
npm pack
```

This creates a `.tgz` package of your frontend project.

> ✅ On DRDO system:

```bash
npm install ./your-frontend-app-X.X.X.tgz
```

---

### A.4: Build Angular App (on DRDO system)

Once dependencies are installed:

```bash
ng build --prod
```

---

### 🐍 B. BACKEND (Python – FastAPI or Flask)

You'll need:

* **Python 3.10+**
* **All Python dependencies (from `requirements.txt`)**

---

#### B.1: Install Python

Download the installer (Windows or Linux) from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and transfer to the offline system.

> ✅ Verify: `python --version` and `pip --version`

---

#### B.2: Freeze and Download Dependencies

From your dev system:

```bash
cd backend
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Then:

```bash
pip download -r requirements.txt -d ./offline-packages
```

This downloads all required `.whl` and `.tar.gz` packages to `offline-packages/`.

> ✅ Transfer `offline-packages/` and `requirements.txt` to DRDO

---

#### B.3: Install Dependencies Offline (on DRDO)

```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links=offline-packages -r requirements.txt
```

---

#### B.4: Run the Backend

Still on DRDO system:

```bash
cd backend
python app.py  # or however your backend starts
```

---

## 🌐 C. OPTIONAL: Serve Angular from Python Backend

If DRDO requires a single-app deployment, you can move the Angular `dist/` output to backend's static folder and serve it via Flask/FastAPI.

Let me know if you need help with that.

---

## 🧳 3. Prepare Everything for Transfer

Put the following on a USB or secure transfer medium:

```
DRDO-offline-deploy/
├── node-vX.X.X.pkg/.exe/.tar.xz     # Node installer
├── angular-cli-X.X.X.tgz            # Angular CLI
├── your-frontend-app-X.X.X.tgz      # Angular project
├── python-X.X.X.exe                 # Python installer
├── backend/
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── offline-packages/
└── README-OFFLINE-INSTALL.md        # Instructions for DRDO setup
```

---

## 📝 4. Sample Offline Setup Instruction (README-OFFLINE-INSTALL.md)

Include step-by-step commands like:

```bash
# 1. Install Node.js and Angular CLI
node -v
npm install -g ./angular-cli-X.X.X.tgz

# 2. Install frontend
cd frontend
npm install ./your-frontend-app-X.X.X.tgz
ng build --prod

# 3. Install Python
python --version
pip install --no-index --find-links=offline-packages -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run backend
cd backend
python app.py
```

---

Would you like me to generate the `README-OFFLINE-INSTALL.md` for you based on your current project details?
